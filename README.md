## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - ReactJS  
  - TailwindCSS  
  - JavaScript
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS):**  
  - Appwrite (for database, authentication, and other backend services)
- **State Management:**  
  - React Redux  
  - Redux Persist

## Architecture

- **Frontend Layer:**  
  Developed with ReactJS and styled using TailwindCSS, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface. The application state is managed using Redux and persisted across sessions with Redux Persist.
  
- **Backend Layer:**  
  Appwrite serves as the BaaS, handling database operations, user authentication, and other server-side functionalities, thereby allowing for rapid development and deployment.
